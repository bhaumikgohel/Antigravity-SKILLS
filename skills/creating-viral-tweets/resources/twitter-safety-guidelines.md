# Twitter Safety & Compliance Guidelines

To ensure your tweets perform well and comply with X's policies, follow these rules:

### 1. Character Limit
- **Max 280 characters**: Ensure every tweet (including links and hashtags) fits within the limit. Aim for 140-200 for maximum visual impact.

### 2. Content Quality
- **Avoid Spam**: Do not include more than 2-3 hashtags. Over-tagging can lead to being "shadowbanned."
- **Professionalism**: Even when being "clickbaity," avoid offensive language, hate speech, or harassment.
- **Accuracy**: Avoid sensationalist claims that are factually incorrect (to prevent Community Notes).

### 3. Algorithm Best Practices
- **Media**: Tweets with images or videos generally perform 2-3x better. Mention if an image should be attached.
- **Engagement**: The best time to post is when your specific audience is active. 
- **Threads**: Use the 🧵 emoji in the first tweet to signal a thread.

### 4. Terms of Service
- Do not encourage illegal activities.
- Respect intellectual property; don't post copyrighted content without permission.
- Avoid "Engagement Bait" that explicitly asks for Likes/Follows in a spammy way (unless contextualized in a thread).
