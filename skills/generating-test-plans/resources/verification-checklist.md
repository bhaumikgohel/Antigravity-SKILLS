# Test Plan Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to evaluate the quality and completeness of a test plan document.

| Section | Checkpoint | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Completeness** | Are all core sections (Scope, Criteria, Risks) present? | [ ] | |
| **Clarity** | Is the descriptive text clear and unambiguous? | [ ] | |
| **Scope** | Are "Features Not to be Tested" explicitly listed? | [ ] | |
| **Criteria** | Are Pass/Fail criteria specific and measurable? | [ ] | |
| **Environment** | Are the environment hardware/software requirements defined? | [ ] | |
| **Deliverables** | Are the expected outputs (logs, reports) listed? | [ ] | |
| **Risks** | Are risks identified along with mitigation plans? | [ ] | |
| **Responsibilities** | Is it clear who is responsible for each task? | [ ] | |

## Quality Assessment
- **Poor**: Missing multiple core sections or vague content.
- **Fair**: Most sections present but lacking detail in criteria or risks.
- **Excellent**: Comprehensive, detailed, and measurable across all sections.
