# Creating Viral LinkedIn Posts

This skill helps you craft high-engagement LinkedIn posts that are concise, structured for readability, and optimized for the LinkedIn algorithm.

## When to use this skill
- When you have a topic or idea and want to turn it into a LinkedIn post.
- When you want to increase visibility and engagement with your professional network.
- When you need a quick, safe, and professional post with relevant hashtags.

## Workflow

1. **Ideation**:
   - Take the user's input topic.
   - Brainstorm a "hook" (the first line) that grabs attention within the first 3 lines of the feed.

2. **Drafting**:
   - Keep sentences short.
   - Use line breaks for white space.
   - Ensure the tone is professional, insightful, and bold.

3. **Optimization**:
   - Add a "Call to Action" (CTA) to encourage comments.
   - Include 3-5 high-relevance hashtags.
   - Verify against [LinkedIn Safety Guidelines](resources/safety-guidelines.md).

4. **Review**:
   - Present the post to the user.
   - Provide 2 variations: (1) Story-driven and (2) List/Insight-driven.

## Instructions

### 1. The "Hook" Logic
The first sentence is everything. It must stop the scroll.
- **Good Hooks**: "I learned this the hard way...", "Most people think X, but the truth is Y.", "3 steps to achieve [Goal] in half the time."

### 2. Formatting Rules
- **No giant paragraphs**: One sentence per line where possible.
- **Emojis**: Use subtle emojis to emphasize points (e.g., 🚀, ✅, 💡). Don't overdo it.
- **CTA**: Always end with a question to spark conversation.

### 3. Content Safety
- **No Offensive Content**: Avoid controversial topics that violate professional standards.
- **No Spam**: Ensure the content provides actual value, not just "clickbait" without substance.
- **Guideline Compliance**: Strictly follow LinkedIn's professional community policies.
