# LinkedIn Safety & Verification Guidelines

To ensure your post stays within professional standards and follows LinkedIn's community policies, verify the following before posting:

### 1. Professionalism Check
- **No Offensive Language**: Avoid profanity or derogatory terms.
- **Respectful Tone**: Even when disagreeing with the "status quo," remain respectful to others in the industry.
- **Relevancy**: Ensure the content is professional/career-related or offers a meaningful personal-growth insight.

### 2. Algorithm Optimization
- **Originality**: Don't copy-paste viral posts exactly; add your unique perspective.
- **Hashtag Count**: Stick to 3-5 hashtags. More can make the post look like spam.
- **Tagging**: Only tag people if they are actually relevant to the post and likely to respond.

### 3. Clickbait vs. Clickworthy
- **Clickworthy**: A strong hook that promises value and then *delivers* it.
- **Clickbait (Avoid)**: Sensationalist claims that have nothing to do with the actual content of the post.

### 4. Engagement Best Practices
- **Respond quickly**: The first 60 minutes of a post are crucial. Try to reply to early comments.
- **Visuals**: If adding an image, ensure it is high quality and relevant to the text.
